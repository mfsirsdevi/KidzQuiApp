# KidzQui
  This project is aimed to provide kids a better way to learn mathematics. They have an easy and lucid guide to learn and enhance their
mathematical ability. The application will help the students, parents and faculties equally in managing tests, getting instant results and
tracking the improvement of the student. On a general point of view, it will look more like a game rather than mathematics course for the students. Yet it will be powerful enough to guide the students in a proper manner.
